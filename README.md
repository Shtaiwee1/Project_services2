We used the Agile methodolody in this project which divided our project implementation into four stages:Initiation,Planning,In progress,Review,Done.


About us :

Our story began with everyday problems encountered by common citizens in our community including ourselves,a lot of us had maintenance to be done in our households that we had absolutely zero to none idea on how to deal with them,therefore trying to find the people of experience in different fields to solve these problems for us by asking acquaintances who might or might not know the right man for the job,and even when you reach the right person, sometimes the job is done poorly, which results in it coming back at the future, and so this became the ground for our idea to grow and florish, building bridges between people with daily issues and people of expertise in these fields.
